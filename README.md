# FiveM Loading Screen - Ian McClellan Entertainment Design

## Overview

The "fivemloading-imlxd" repository contains a custom loading screen for the FiveM modification for the popular video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). This loading screen features a minimalistic design and can be customized to include your own logo, background video, and audio.

## Installation

To use this loading screen in your FiveM server, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release of the "fivemloading-imlxd" repository from GitHub.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Navigate to the "html" folder within the extracted files.
4. Customize the "index.html" file with your own logo, background image, and loading text. You can do this using any text editor, such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.

## Customization

To customize the loading screen, you can modify the "index.html" file. Here are some things you can customize:

### Logo

To add your own logo, replace the "logo.png" file with your own logo file. The recommended size for the logo is at least 512x512 pixels.

### Background Image

To add your own background image, replace the "video.mp4" file with your own video file. The recommended size for the background video is at least 1920x1080 pixels, but highly recommended that aspect ration 16x9 is used for FiveM Compatability.
